Day 10: Web App Pentesting (DVWA + Burp Suite)

Setup Steps:
- Installed Burp Suite Community Edition and opened a temporary project
- Configured Firefox to send traffic through Burp using proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
- Cloned DVWA into /var/www/html/dvwa and fixed missing config.php issue
- Gave permissions and restarted Apache and MySQL
- Set DVWA security level to "Low"

Attacks Performed:

1. Reflected XSS:
Payload used: <script>alert('pwned')</script>
Injected in input field, caused an immediate popup (proof of execution)

2. Stored XSS:
Payload used: <script>alert('stored')</script>
Injected into guestbook form, triggered for anyone visiting that page

3. SQL Injection:

4. Command Injection:
Payload used: 127.0.0.1; whoami
Pinged localhost and then executed a command showing server user: www-data

Conclusion:
All core web pentesting tasks completed successfully.
