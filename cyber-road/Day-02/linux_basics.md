# 🐧 Day 02 – Linux Basics (File System & Terminal)

## ✅ What I Practiced
- `pwd` – shows current directory
- `ls` – lists folders/files
- `cd` – move between folders
- `mkdir` – create a folder
- `touch` – create a file
- `rm` – delete a file
- `rmdir` – delete a folder
- `clear` – clears the screen

## 💡 What I Learned
- Linux uses `/` not `\` in paths
- Everything is case-sensitive
- `~` means home directory
- You can manage files/folders entirely from terminal

## 🔥 Next Up
