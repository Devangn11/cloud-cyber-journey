# Day 09: Common Exploits + Manual Enumeration

## 🔐 Focus: Privilege Escalation via pkexec (CVE-2021-4034)

### ✅ What I Did:
- Explored SUID binaries via `find / -perm -4000`
- Focused on `pkexec` for potential privesc
- Attempted exploit using public PoCs and local compilation
- Encountered permission issues, patched binaries
- Learned how to test, debug, and handle real-world exploit failures

### 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Not every exploit works out-of-the-box
- pkexec was patched in my VM
- Learned to analyze `cron`, permissions, and file ownership

### 🚫 Exploit Status:
Did not succeed (patched system) — moved to safe enumeration.

🧠 Learned how PwnKit works, tested multiple PoCs, and confirmed it's patched on my VM. No root, but tons of learning.
Will come back to it on a vulnerable box later.
